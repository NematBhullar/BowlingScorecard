# Bowling Scorecard

## 1. About 
The goal of bowling is simple – to knock down as many pins as possible. The more pins you knock down, the more points you score. A game consists of 10 frames with a maximum of 2 rolls.

Strikes
If a player knocks down all 10 pins in the first roll of the frame, they obtain a 'strike'. The frame ends immediately and the bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next 2 rolls. 

Spares
If a player knocks down all 10 pins using both rolls of a frame, they obtain a 'spare'. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first roll of the next frame).

10th frame
If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus (but can only roll a maximum of 3 balls in the 10th frame). The additional rolls only count for the bonus, not for the regular frame count.
